        <h1>Weed control including several steps:</h1>
    </div><!-- /header -->

    <div role="main" class="ui-content">
        <p class="text-justify"><strong>First step: </strong>this is the destruction of overgrown weeds after provocative irrigation with a continuous herbicide in August-September. The herbicide is applied if there are perennial weeds; if they are absent, there is no need to contaminate the soil with herbicide. Annual weeds are destroyed by plowing.</p>
        <p class="text-justify"><strong>Second step: </strong>the use of pre-emergence (soil) herbicides before sowing. They are embedded in the soil by harrowing or pre-sowing cultivation - without embedding, their efficiency is lower, especially in arid conditions. In addition, soil herbicides work effectively only in the presence of a sufficient amount of moisture, and in case of heavy precipitation they are washed out into the lower layers.</p>
       
        <p class="text-justify">Among the methods of struggle, you can choose from two directions:  </p>
        <ul>
            <li>combinations of pre-emergence (soil) herbicides with post-emergence;  </li>
            <li> the use of only post emergence herbicides.  </li>
            
        </ul>
        <h4>From pre-emergence herbicides on the market there are:  </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Dual Gold (d.v. S-metolachlor 960 g / l) against annual cereals and some cotyledons; n </li>
            <li>Pyramided Turbo (a.i. chloridazone 520 g / l) versus annual cotyledons; </li>
            <li>Mitron, Pilot, Goltix (d. Century metamitron 700 g / l) versus annual dicotyledons;</li>
			 <li>Frontier Optima (dimetinamide-P 720 g / l) against annual cereals and some dicotyledons. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-justify">You can also use herbicides with a. In. etofumezate and lenacil.</p>
        <p class="text-justify"><strong>Third step: </strong>the use of postemergence herbicides. All possible situations must be considered here. Various weeds, depending on the anatomical and morphological structure and physiological characteristics, react differently to herbicides. For some, one dose is enough to destroy, others are more stable, and they need a higher concentration. Therefore, when choosing a dose of a chemical, one should first pay attention to problem weeds. The most vulnerable developmental phase for dicotyledonous weeds is the cotyledon phase. Considering that weeds sprout in "waves" due to physiological characteristics, one has to work separately for each "wave" of seedlings, and the number of herbicide treatments can reach four. The main task is to keep the sowing of beets free of weeds for the first two months after germination. After this period, sugar beet is already quite developed; it closes the row spacing, shading the weeds, thereby restraining their development. Subsequent emergence of weeds also damages the sugar beet crop, but not as dramatically as the first waves. Since there are no universal herbicides, and the action of herbicides is selective in relation to weeds, it is necessary to combine preparations to increase the effectiveness of control and complete destruction of weeds, especially in fields with mixed weeds.</p> 
<p class="text-justify">In the scheme of weed control on sugar beet crops, the central place is occupied by preparations containing phenmedipham - desmedipham - etofumezate (bet anal group), which act against most dicotyledonous annuals. To enhance the effectiveness of betanals against problematic dicotyledons (Theophrastus rope-plant, schiritsa), they can be combined with trisulfuron-methyl (Caribou, Triceps, Condor), if quinoa, white marrow, schiritsa are present, as well as with metamitron and chloridazone, which also have a soil effect ... If the sowing contains perennial dicotyledons (sow thistles, chamomile and some others), then herbicides based on clopyralid are used (Lontrel 300, Lornet, Hacker).</p>
<p class="text-justify">It is important to note that annual dicotyledonous weeds are well destroyed in the cotyledon stage with low herbicide rates. It is necessary to work against perennial dicotyledonous weeds when they reach 15â€“20 cm in height. The lower the annual weed, the more sensitive it is: the thickness of the waxes on the leaf is less, and the leaf surface area to the total weight of the plant is greater. In perennials, the leaf area relative to the total weight of the plant (taking into account the weight of the roots) increases with the development of plants. Naturally, the effective dose of chemicals absorbed by the leaf surface of the plant during spraying also increases. </p>
<p class="text-justify">If sugar beet plants experience herbicidal stress, foliar feeding with mixtures of macro- and microelements (Mn, Zn, Fe, Cu), liquid phosphorus fertilizers, amino acids, humates can be applied. This can have a positive effect on the health of the beets.
