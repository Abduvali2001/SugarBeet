    </div><!-- /header -->

    <div role="main" class="ui-content">
        <p class="text-justify">Among the factors influencing the yield of sugar beet root crops, weeds play an important role. Even with a weak infestation, losses reach 20-30% of the yield, and with a strong infestation, they oppress the main crop, and losses can reach up to 80% or more. Weeds complicate machine harvesting and are the host carriers of pathogens and pests (nematodes, root aphids, cercospora).</p>
 <p class="text-justify">Weed control should be carried out at all stages of the crop rotation, especially on those crops where it is economically cheap and justified, for example, on grain crops. You should not artificially litter the soil by introducing seeds with fresh organic fertilizers (manure). If necessary, it is better to apply such manure under the previous crop of sugar beet, where weed control is not so problematic. It is necessary to destroy the weeds on the boundaries between the two plots, plowing and mowing each year, preventing weeds from seeding, although most of the owners of the fields do not touch the boundary for years, on which weeds grow to the height of a person.</p>
 <p class="text-justify">Weeds can be destroyed mechanically and chemically. Mechanical methods for reducing weediness include autumn plowing after provocative irrigation, inter-row loosening, destruction by continuous cultivation of growing weeds in late autumn after autumn ploughing and before sowing in spring. The combination of mechanical and chemical methods of control is also important. Conducting inter-row loosening, at the same time, the row area is sprayed with a belt method with a weed control chemical. At the same time, the loss of the chemical is halved and the load on the ecosystem is reduced.</p>
 <p class="text-justify">In the chemical method of weed control, herbicides are used. Successful control is possible only with knowledge of the types of weeds, since the correct selection of herbicides and their dosage depends on this. The simplest classification divides weeds into dicotyledonous (broad-leaved) and monocotyledonous (cereal, narrow-leaved). Monocots are plants in which seedlings appear in one lobe - one leaf like wheat, barley, corn, and dicotyledons - with two cotyledons (two leaves, like sugar beet, beans). In terms of life expectancy, cotyledons and monocots are conditionally one-year-old (they are seeded only once in their life, then they die off) and perennial (they are seeded many times during their life, their aboveground part dies off for the winter, but the roots remain, from which new aboveground parts develop annually ).
