        <p class="text-justify">Without it, it is impossible to cultivate beets in the conditions of Kyrgyzstan. Irrigation is the key to harvesting. The best water regime for sugar beets is ensured when, at a depth of 60–70 cm, soil moisture does not fall below 70% of the full field moisture capacity in the period before July 1, and in the subsequent growth period, this indicator is at least 80%. Leaves dry out prematurely, roots break off, photosynthesis is disrupted, and the yield is reduced to 35%. Excessive watering is also harmful, since air, water, and thermal regimes are disturbed, water overruns and a rise in the level of groundwater are noted, leading to soaking and the development of root rot, especially on hot sunny days. </p>
 <p class="text-justify">During the growing season of sugar beets, 60% of the water is consumed as transpiration through the leaves, and 40% is used for evaporation. The beginning of the first growing season depends on the weather conditions and the condition of the plants. In dry spring, watering can begin from the end of May, and in wet rainy weather, the first watering is postponed until the second half or end of June. </p>
 <p class="text-justify">Легкий, с небольшой нормой, предкопочный полив при сухих почвенных условиях должен производиться за 10–12 дней до уборки. Это облегчает копку сахарной свеклы и создает условия для получения корней в хорошем тургорном состоянии. </p>
 <p class="text-justify">Currently, the following irrigation methods are used in the cultivation of beets:  
</p>
<ul>
            <li>furrowed;  </li>
            <li>sprinkling;  </li>
            <li>drip irrigation.  </li>
        </ul>
		<p class="text-justify">The most common furrow hand. With this method, the recommended water regime of the soil is maintained by 4–5 irrigations per growing season on medium and heavy loams and 5–8 irrigations on light loams and sandy loams with a close occurrence of pebbles. At a groundwater level of 1 to 2.5 m, 2-3 irrigations are sufficient.</p>		
   <p class="text-justify">It is important for furrow irrigation to take into account the size of the water stream, the length of the furrow, the level of the slope of the field and the permeability of the soil. If the slope of the field is large, then the amount of water jet into the furrow should be small (0.05–0.15 l / sec) in order to avoid soil erosion. With a large stream of water, the best part of the soil, fine earth, is irretrievably lost. This is most important in the foothill areas. To regulate the stream of water, it is necessary to use materials at hand: polyethylene film, turf, tubes, etc. With low water permeability of the soil (heavy and medium loam), the length of the furrow increases to 200 meters or more, starting from 100–120 m, depending on the slope.</p>
     <p class="text-justify"><strong>Sprinkling</strong> his is a more progressive and productive method of irrigation, which has many systems and modifications, but in the republic, for various reasons, single farms are used.  </p>
	   <p class="text-justify"><strong>Drip irrigation </strong> on beets in this period has almost scanty use.</p>
