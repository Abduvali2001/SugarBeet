    <div role="main" class="ui-content">
        <p class="text-center">What to do if it is clogged with cereals?</p>
        <p class="text-justify">Anti-cereal herbicides or graminicides (in Latin, cereal - Graminea) are widely represented: Zellek-super (d.v. Galaxifop-R-methyl), Miura (d.v. chizalofop-P-ethyl), Heler (d.v. quizalofop -P-tefuryl), Fuzilad forte (d.v. fluazafop-P-butyl) and others. The sensitivity of cereals to them is high. For effective action, it is necessary that annual cereal weeds have 3-4 leaves, and perennial weeds reach 10-15 cm in height. Accordingly, the dosages of chemicals for weed control are different: the older the weeds, especially perennial ones, the more developed they are, the higher the rate of application of the drug.</p>
 <p class="text-justify">To successfully combat weeds, you must adhere to some rules: 
</p>
        <ul>
 <li>The best biological effectiveness of herbicides is achieved at a surface air temperature of 12–25 ° C; and at temperatures above 25 ° C and strong solar radiation, it is impossible to spray, there is a risk of damage to the crop. In such cases, it is better to spray in the morning or evening hours, you can at night.</li>
 <li>In order to avoid drift by the wind, it is necessary to apply herbicides at a wind speed of less than 5 m / s.</li>
 <li>If abundant dew falls out, when it drips from the leaves, it is impossible to spray.
 
</li>
 <li>•	If the applied preparations do not contain oil emulsions, the addition of oils at the rate of 0.5–2 l / ha can improve the penetrating effect of herbicides through the waxy layer of leaves in dry weather.</li>
 <li>•	it is advisable to finish the treatment 4 hours before the rain falls. If caught in the rain, then re-work no earlier than 4 days later.</li>
 <li>•	for the preparation and mixing of working solutions of pesticides, the water must be clean and of good quality. Dirty water binds active substances (glyphosate, diquat are sensitive). If a 1 som coin is poorly viewed at the bottom of an ordinary bucket (10-12 liters), the water is considered dirty. Hard water (high content of calcium and magnesium salts) can lead to precipitation of some chemical elements (glyphosate, 2,4 D amine salt, clopyralid). Soap dissolves poorly in hard water. At pH> 8 (high alkalinity of water), pesticides (glyphosate, clopyralid) degrade and reduce their effectiveness. </li>
 <li>•	water should not be cold or hot - this affects the solubility and action of chemical elements. If you have to use poor quality water, spraying should be done immediately after preparing the solution.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-justify">To monitor the effectiveness of herbicides on the field, it is necessary to leave control areas (1-2 points) measuring 0.5x 0.5 m or 1.0x 1.0 m, not treated with a chemical (they must be covered with foil when spraying). This allows you to identify dead weed species, as well as trace the emergence of new weeds.</p>
