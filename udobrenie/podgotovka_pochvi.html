        <p class="text-center">Autumn tillage.</p>
        <p class="text-justify">Soil cultivation for sowing occurs after the harvesting of the previous crop. Usually it starts with stubble plowing to a depth of 8–10 cm, for which they use heavy disc harrows. This achieves the incorporation of weed seeds and grain fall, crushing crop residues, and the destruction of weeds and pests. Afterwards, pre-plowing irrigation is carried out, which also called provoking and moisture is charging. It provokes sprouting of weed seeds, covered with hulling. In the future, they are destroyed, due to which the weediness is reduced (up to 20%), the moisture reserve in the soil increases. The moisture reserve in the spring contributes to more friendly germination, better rooting of plants. They suffer less from spring drought and allow you to postpone the first watering to a later date (up to 10-12 days).</p>
        <p class="text-justify">If there are perennial weeds among the sprouted as a result of pre-plowing irrigation (field bindweed, pink thistle, pork finger, reed (reed), etc.), it is necessary to treat them with a general exterminating herbicide (it is also called a continuous herbicide), for example, glyphosate-containing, to destroy them. According to the regulations, when applied, it is kept for at least two weeks after processing (three can be used) to exterminate not only the upper vegetative part, but also the root system. For perennial weeds, the effectiveness of glyphosate increases with plant growth when the ratio of the area of leaves exposed to the chemical to the total plant weight is high. Therefore, it is better to process them when they reach a height of 15–20 cm.</p>
              <p class="text-justify">The best time to process is a day when the leaves are perpendicular to the sun and the stem. Dust covering the plants reduces the effectiveness of glyphosate. This also happens if the water used for spraying is dirty or hard (contains more than 5 mmol / l Ca and Mg salts). To soften the water, use special additives or fertilizer ammonium sulfate (from 10 to 20 kg per 1 ton of water). First dissolve the water softeners then only the glyphosate. To reduce the negative impact of low-quality water, lower rates of the working solution are used.</p>
               <p class="text-justify">After holding the regulated time and the onset of visible signs of weed death, fertilizers are applied and plowing is carried out. The best quality plowing is obtained using reversible plows. They do not leave dump ridges and plowing on the field, the plowing is consistent and uniform. The soil should not stick to the plow, the layer should not fall like a ribbon and shine, but should be divided into lumps. The ripening of the soil can be checked as follows: take a lump of earth in your hands, squeeze it and throw it from a height of 1 meter, if the lump crumbles, then the soil is ready.</p>
               <p class="text-justify">The depth of ploughing, subject to crop rotation, is as follows: after alfalfa for winter cereals - 30–32 cm, after cereals for beets - 27–28 cm, after beets for cereals - 22–23 cm. That is, compaction, which is formed with constant ploughing at the same depth and further prevents the growth of root crops, normal soil moisture permeability. When plowing, it is necessary to take into account the thickness of the arable layer, do not turn the infertile horizon. </p>
        <p class="text-justify">The ploughing depth is easy to control. A metal pin-rod with a diameter of 10-15mm is taken. On the diagonal of the field in 10-15 places, the measurement is carried out as follows: a pin is inserted into the ploughing slightly rammed by the foot. As soon as the pin reaches the seal, you need to stop. For ease of measurement, you can make notches on the pin every centimetre using a regular ruler. The average of all measurements is the ploughing depth.</p>
               <p class="text-justify">All of the above actions are carried out at the end of August - September, and this is where the autumn work ends. You can also lightly level the field after the soil has settled.</p>
        <p class="text-justify">Advantages of autumn plowing with pre-plowing irrigation: the weediness of the field decreases - the number of pests (winter moths, fleas, aphids, etc.) decreases due to the lack of a forage base; all microbiological processes in the soil are restored; a large supply of moisture accumulates in the autumn-winter period; the existing equipment is used rationally and the beet yield is increased by 10-15%.</p>
 <p class="text-justify">It is wrong to postpone the main tillage until the spring. During spring plowing, the soil does not have time to settle and restore capillaries. Because of this, insufficient moisture is drawn to the seeds, and as a result, the seedlings are sparse and uneven. To this must be added the spring excitement with technology, its shortage and lack of time. If the tillage was nevertheless postponed for the spring, it is carried out at least two weeks before sowing. But you should always remember that spring plowing is the worst possible option.</p>
