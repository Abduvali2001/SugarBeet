        <p class="text-justify">There are a number of parameters to consider in order to clean during a warm dry season. With a delay and in years with unstable weather, difficulties arise for the work of people and equipment, productivity decreases, contamination of raw beets and crop losses increase; and the worse the weather, the higher the losses (up to 20%). </p>
 <p class="text-justify">Peeled root crops in case of untimely removal must be covered to maintain the weight of the beets. It is known that in dry hot weather for the first day, beets left in small piles without a cover lose up to 7% of their weight. </p>
 <p class="text-justify">Choosing the sequence of harvesting fields, first, it is necessary to harvest crops with high-sugar hybrids, which earlier reach the maximum yield. In addition, fields with low yields, where there is clearly not enough time for their growth, should be harvested as quickly as possible. It is also important to harvest root crops with leaves damaged by the disease (cercosporosis, powdery mildew), since new leaves will grow on them due to the sugar reserves in the root crop.</p>
 <p class="text-justify">In wet soil or in rainy weather conditions, harvesting with heavy implements has a negative effect on the soil structure. It is compacted; ruts are formed after the passes of the equipment. This complicates the preparation of the soil for sowing the next crop, and reduces the yield. </p>
  <p class="text-justify">It is necessary to avoid unnecessary idle vehicle passes through the field.</p>
