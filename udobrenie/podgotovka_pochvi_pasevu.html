	<p class="text-center">Spring tillage.</p>
        <p class="text-justify">Spring activities begin with early harrowing at an angle to ploughing. This is done with the aim of destroying the top layer of the capillaries of the soil and is carried out as soon as it becomes possible to leave the field so that the soil does not stick. This agronomic technique is used to maximize moisture retention (also called moisture closure). It is known that for 1 day on a clear warm day with a weak wind, the loss of moisture from the surface of the field can reach up to 120 m3 per 1 hectare (12 mm).</p>
 <p class="text-justify">In spring, we often experience a rapid rise in soil and air temperature. The lag in moisture closure leads to a large loss of moisture from the soil. The surface of the soil is covered with a dense crust and, upon further processing, it turns out to be coarsely lumpy, which does not contribute to a satisfactory seeding of seeds during sowing. Preservation of moisture reserves will contribute to obtaining friendly and full shoots.  </p>
  <p class="text-justify">Sugar beet is an early sowing crop. Seedlings can withstand short-term (several hours) frosts down to –5 ° С without wind, they can easily tolerate temperature drops to –1 ... –3 ° С. </p>
   <p class="text-justify">When do you start sowing beets? When the soil warms up at a depth of 6–7 cm up to + 7… + 8 ° С. In the conditions of the Chui Valley, the sowing period practically begins from the third decade of March. According to popular beliefs, the massive sowing of beets coincides with the beginning of flowering of early apricots (apricots). A delay in sowing relative to the optimal time leads to a shortage of crops on average 0.5–0.7 tons / ha per day. This is about 1%, that is, with a delay of 10 days, one tenth of the harvest is lost.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">When the sowing time comes, it is necessary to level the small soil and pre-sowing continuous cultivation with a compactor or other similar unit to a depth of 3-4 cm. too deep cultivation worsens the contact of seeds with the soil, replenishment of seeds with capillary moisture. Continuous cultivation creates a loose top layer, cuts off all weeds that have sprouted up to this point. This provides equal starting conditions for the germination of both beets and weeds, whose seed stocks are in the soil.</p>
	 <p class="text-justify">Sowing is carried out immediately after pre-sowing cultivation (or with a time gap of no more than a day). This is done to avoid drying out the top layer and making full use of moisture reserves. For those who carry out sowing of beets a few days after pre-sowing cultivation, weeds emerge earlier than beets. An untrained beet grower finds himself in a quandary.</p>
	  <p class="text-justify">Sowing is carried out with pneumatic or mechanical precision seed drills to a depth of 2-3 cm. At the same time, the optimal speed of the seeder to ensure uniform seeding between seeds in a row and seeding at the same depth without gaps is 6-7 km / h for pneumatic and 5-6 km / hour for mechanical seeders.</p>
	   <p class="text-justify">The row spacing is from 45 to 60 cm. For the plants themselves, a row spacing of 45 cm is more comfortable in terms of the shape of the feeding area (length to width ratio). We sow based on the availability of technology and ease of care for the sowing. I had to meet a row spacing even of 70 cm, two-line or band sowing 60 + 30. Sowing with a row spacing of 45 or 50 cm is convenient when irrigating with sprinklers, when there is no need to cut furrows, and the micro relief of the soil surface plays a lesser role during irrigation. Sowing 60 cm is convenient for cutting deeper inter-row furrows. This contributes to less flooding of lowlands, conduction of water to higher places, that is, high-quality irrigation. According to scientific research from the 60s, sowing with a row spacing of 60 cm does not reduce yields by 45 cm compared to sowing. </p>
	    <p class="text-justify">The seeding rate with a row spacing of 45 cm should be 5–6 seeds per 1 meter of row length or 1.1–1.3 sowing units per 1 hectare; with a row spacing of 60 cm - 6–7 seeds per meter of a row or 1.0–1.15 sowing units per hectare (with a laboratory germination rate of at least 96%).</p>
		 <p class="text-justify">The seeding rate with a row spacing of 45 cm should be 5–6 seeds per 1 meter of row length or 1.1–1.3 sowing units per 1 hectare; with a row spacing of 60 cm - 6–7 seeds per meter of a row or 1.0–1.15 sowing units per hectare (with a laboratory germination rate of at least 96%). </p>
		  <p class="text-justify">Another novelty is the Geocontrol system. Provides the possibility of differentiated sowing and automatic shutdown of the seeder sections when sowing wedges, turns, etc., which saves seeds, not allowing sowing on the sown.</p>
		   <p class="text-justify">The third is the laying of tramlines. When sowing with a row spacing of 45 cm, it allows chemical treatments with pesticides, foliar top dressing, and application of mineral fertilizers with wide-cut aggregates both in the daytime and at night with high quality</p>
		    <p class="text-justify">One of the mistakes in preparing for sowing is deep seedbed cultivation. An excessively loose top layer leads to uneven seed placement in depth, poor contact of the seed with the soil, the capillary feeding of seeds with moisture is disturbed - as a result, non-squeezed seedlings are obtained, different in growth and development.</p>
