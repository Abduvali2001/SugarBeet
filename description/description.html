Sugar is the best source of energy to stimulate the mind, memory, strength and endurance of the human body.<br /> Sugar beet - the culture from which they get: sugar, molasses, pulp.<br />Molasses is used in the production of alcohol, bread yeast and the confectionery industry and is a biofuel (ethanol).<br />
		Pulp is an excellent feed for livestock, pectin and citric acid are obtained.<br />The leaves are used as animal feed and fertilizer.<br />
	</p>
	 <p class="text-center"><strong>How to get a stable yield of 100-120 tons of sugar beet per hectare?</strong></p>
        <p class="text-justify">It must be remembered that beets are a plastic crop and are cultivated in our country on a wide variety of soils. These are varieties of gray soils, meadow, chestnut, chernozem soils. Their fertility is low, i.e. the humus content is from 0.8 to 5%, in the main agricultural zone of the Chui valley - up to 2.2%, a low level of mineral elements nitrogen, assailable phosphorus and potassium. With total nitrogen 0.10-0.30%, total phosphorus P2O5 - 0.2-0.3% and potassium K2O - 2.0-3.5%, the amount of mobile phosphoric acid is 0.3-6.4 mg, exchangeable potassium - 12–180 mg per 100 g of soil, and the pH of the soil solution ranges from 7.5–8.8. The removal of nutrients from the soil from one ton of beets is: N - 3.5–4.5 kg, P2O5 - 1.5–2 kg, K2O - 6–7.5 kg; with wheat grain yield N - 37 kg, P2O5 - 13 kg, K2O - 32 kg. The constant removal of nutrients from the soil leads to depletion of the soil and, naturally, to a decrease in the yields of agricultural crops and the income of the farmer. This requires a careful approach. To maintain the level of soil fertility and its health, it is necessary to return nutrients to it and follow some rules.</p>
		<p class="text-justify">1. Use of fertilizers:  <br /> •	mineral;  <br />•	•	organic: manure, compost, vermicomposting, poultry droppings, waste from biogas plants, ploughing of straw and post-harvest residues, etc.; <br />•	•	green manure or green manure <br />2. Minimization of tillage. Fight against over consolidation, sputtering or structure breakdown, erosion protection.
<br />3. Compliance with the correct crop rotation.
</p>
 <p class="text-center"><strong>1. Use of fertilizers</strong></p>
    <p class="text-justify"> Any soil in the cultivation of crops can provide a high yield for many years, and reserves of some nutrients will last for centuries. But the fact is that not all nutrients are in a form readily available to plants. Therefore, soils need to be replenished with readily soluble nutrient salts in the form of various fertilizers.
 <p class="text-justify"> There is such a concept as the utilization rate of nutrients by plants. In the soil, in mineral, in organic fertilizers, they are different, and when cultivating agricultural crops, they must be taken into account. So, from the soil reserves, according to averaged data, the use of nitrogen (N) is 35–45%, phosphorus (P2O5) - 10–20%, potassium (K2O) - 20–30%. Of the applied mineral nitrogen fertilizers in the first year, only 55–65% is used and 10% in the second year; phosphorus - 15-25%, in the second year - 15%, in the third year - 10%; potassium - 65–75%, in the second year - 15%, in the third year - 5%. From manure in the first year, N is used - 25%, P2O5 - 40%, K2O - 70%; in the second year - 25%, 15% and 20% of the corresponding elements; in the third - 15%, 10% and 10%; in the fourth - 10%, 5% and 0%, that is, the effect of manure lasts at least 4 years.</p>
<p class="text-justify">When using organic fertilizers, you need to pay attention to their correct manufacture and application. When collected and stored, manure should ripen, and seeds of weeds such as dodder (a difficultly controlled weed in beet and alfalfa crops) should lose germination. To obtain manure of good quality and to avoid the loss of its nutrients, especially the most valuable ammonia nitrogen and organic matter, it must be covered with earth and straw. If manure is not collected in special manure storages, then it must be stored in piles 2–4 meters wide, 1.5–2 m high and of the required length, if the pile is covered with soil up to 20 cm thick. feeds that do not meet modern technology may contain weed seeds. In a ton of cattle manure, who ate such food, can contain up to 2 million weed seeds, pigs - up to 700 thousand seeds, and poultry droppings - up to 200 thousand pieces. All this mass of seeds will fall into the arable layer and can remain viable for decades. For your information, during the season, one instance of the weed forms:
<br />•	chicken millet - up to 1000 seeds;<br />
•	gravy bristles - up to 800; <br />
•	field dodder - from 10 to 50 thousand; ; <br />
•	field bindweed - up to 500 pieces;  <br />
•	pink thistle 3-5 thousand;  <br />
•	cable car Theophrastus - up to 2000 pieces;  <br />
•	white Mary - up to 20 thousand;  <br />
•	shirts - up to 5 thousand.
 </p>
 <p class="text-justify"> Manure is also valuable because, in addition to macronutrients, it contains many microelements. In addition, plants use the nutrients from it gradually, not as when using mineral fertilizers, when applied immediately for a while, the concentration of elements increases sharply.</p>
<p class="text-justify"> In terms of nutrient content, organic fertilizers are unequal: in 1 ton of cattle manure, nitrogen - 5 kg, phosphorus - 2.5 kg, potassium - 7 kg; in chicken manure nitrogen - 19 kg, phosphorus - 14 kg, potassium - 6 kg (at 65-70% humidity).</p>
<p class="text-justify"> The advantage of organic fertilization is also in improving the physical properties of soils, in enhancing the activity of soil micro flora, in addition to providing plants with carbon, increasing the intensity of photosynthesis. </p>
<p class="text-justify"> It is important to know that there should be no time gap between the introduction of manure and its incorporation into the soil. A 24-hour delay with incorporation leads to a decrease in the efficiency of manure by 25%, by four days - 2 times. After spreading poultry manure, 65–70% of ammonia nitrogen is lost from it in 24 hours.</p>
<p class="text-justify"> Using grain straw as an organic fertilizer, you need to know that from 1 ton of winter wheat straw, nitrogen - 5–6 kg, phosphorus - 2 kg, potassium - 9 kg enter the soil. However, this fertilizer is specific. A positive point is the improvement of the agro physical and agrochemical properties of the soil; inconvenience - difficult decomposition of straw, since the organic substances contained in it contain compounds that impart strength, rigidity and hardly solubility. The decomposition rate of straw is in direct proportion to the ratio of carbon and nitrogen contained in it. If the ratio C: N (N = 1) is less than 30: 1, then the straw decomposes faster, if more, then when ploughing straw in the first year, a decrease in yield is observed as a result of additional consumption of soil nitrogen by micro flora decomposing the straw. To eliminate this undesirable phenomenon, it is necessary to add up to 10-15 kg of nitrogen per 1 ton of introduced straw. The C: N ratio in cereal straw is 1: 60–100, in leguminous crops - 1: 20–25. Therefore, when ploughing straw of legumes (soybeans, beans, peas, etc.), nitrogen is not added, and when ploughing wheat or barley straw, additional nitrogen is required.</p> 
<p class="text-justify"> <strong>Green manure  </strong>– is a fresh plant mass, which is ploughed into the soil to enrich it with organic substances. Green fertilizer is smelled in places with low soil fertility or where organic fertilizers are not applied. For green fertilizer, you can use annual legumes: beans, soybeans, peas, sweet clover; perennials - alfalfa, sainfoin, as cultures fixing atmospheric nitrogen, as well as Sudanese grass, rapeseed, mustard. Green fertilizer (also called green manure) can be grown in stubble or undercover forms. In the first case, they are sown after harvesting the main crop, in the second - under its cover. With timely care and watering, a hectare of such sowing yields up to 30–35 t / ha of green mass and up to 7–8 t / ha of root residues, which is equivalent to 30–40 tons of manure. Clay and sandy soils are especially in need of organic fertilization.</p>
<p class="text-center"><strong>2. Minimization of tillage</strong></p>
<p class="text-justify"> The purpose of soil cultivation when growing sugar beets, and indeed any crop, is to create favourable conditions for its growth and development. The optimum composition of the arable layer is soil, the density of which is 1.10–1.30 g / cm3. </p>
<p class="text-justify"> The soil structure can easily break down. Excessive and untimely tillage leads to heavy spraying and over consolidation, resulting in reduced yields. Excessive tillage is a repeated and unjustified impact of machines, and untimely treatment is an early impact on the soil, which sticks and smears during cutting or later, when the soil is over dried, which leads to lumpiness and additional tillage. The use of heavy machinery with high soil moisture leads to compaction and destruction of the soil structure, especially during the harvesting period: driving into the field unnecessarily, grazing cattle. As a result, the soil density in the autumn period for harvesting reaches 1.60-1.70 g / cm2.</p>
<p class="text-justify"> Minimizing the impact on the soil is cultivation at optimal moisture content, the combination of technological operations, the use of combined units, the elimination of unnecessary transport visits to the field and cattle grazing, especially after precipitation and thawing of soils in the winter-spring period.</p>
<p class="text-center"><strong>3. Compliance with the correct crop rotation</strong></p>
<p class="text-justify">Crop rotation is the correct alternation of crops, when crops, different in their biological characteristics, create the best conditions for the growth and development of subsequent crops by a system of soil cultivation and measures to protect plants from diseases, pests, and weeds.</p>
<p class="text-justify">Crop rotation is the foundation of farming. It increases soil fertility. One of the indispensable elements of crop rotation in conditions of high alkalinity of soils and low humus content is the inclusion in the crop rotation of perennial grasses - alfalfa, sainfoin, or cereal-legume mixtures. Alfalfa leaves in the soil layer 0-50 cm in two years of use about 30 t / ha of air-dry mass of roots and crop residues containing 360 kg of nitrogen, 140 kg of phosphorus and 89 kg of potassium. It also improves the state of aggregation, water permeability, and water-holding capacity of the soil. The impact of perennial grasses on soil fertility lasts for 5–7 years or more.</p>
<p class="text-center"><strong>After what crops is it better to place sugar beets?  </strong></p>
<p class="text-justify">First of all, after cereal crops (wheat, barley, oats), since they best of all heal the soil from nematodes and pathogens of beetroot rot.</p>
<p class="text-justify">Sugar beets can be sown after all early harvest crops, which vacate the fields earlier and allow time to prepare the soil for the beets.</p>
<p class="text-center"><strong>Below are examples of crop rotations for beet farms:  </strong></p>
<p class="text-justify">1. Cereals + perennial grasses - perennial grasses of the first year of use - winter wheat - sugar beets. </p>
<p class="text-justify">2. Annual legumes (soybeans, beans) - sugar beets - winter wheat - vegetables.	 </p>
<p class="text-justify">3. Cereals + perennial grasses - perennial grasses of the first year of use - perennial grasses of the second year of use - winter wheat - sugar beets. </p>
<p class="text-center"><strong>After what crops is it undesirable to sow sugar beets? </strong></p>
<p class="text-justify">Beets should not be sown after beets. At the same time, productivity decreases, pests and diseases accumulate. With permanent sowing of beets on beets, such a phenomenon as beet fatigue is increasing. Microbiological analysis showed that this reduces the number of beneficial microorganisms. This inhibits the decomposition of difficult-to-dissolve compounds and their conversion into easily digestible forms (the number of phosphorus bacteria, denitrifies, fungi, oligonitriphils decreases), which reduces the supply of nutrients to the plant. The damage to beets by root rot and nematodes is increasing, which leads to the loss of plants, a decrease in technological qualities. With permanent sowing, even the field germination of seeds is reduced. Therefore, re-sowing beets in the same place is recommended not earlier than after three years. </p>
